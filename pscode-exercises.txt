// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If num can be divided by 2
Num is even
If num can not be divided by 2
Num is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Num1 = 1
Num2 = 2
Num3 = 3
Num4 = 4
Num5 = 5

Amt = amount of individual numbers
Sum = num1+num2+num3+num4+num5
Average = sum of num1+num2+num3+num4+num5 divided by amt
Minimum = if num is less than num2, it is the minimum.
Maximum = if num is more than num4, it is the maximum.

D.) Average = 3
Sum of num1+num2+num3+num4+num5 (15) divided by amt (5). 15 / 5 = 3

Minimum = 1
The number before num2 is num1 (1), so it is the minimum.

Maximum = 5
The number after num4 is num5 (5), so it is the maximum.
